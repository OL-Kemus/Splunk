How to recover data on standalone indexers:


Find logs in -------- > $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log

Consider setting these to DEBUG in log-local.cfg:

category.OnlineFsck = DEBUG
category.Fsck= DEBUG
category.databasePartitionPolicy= DEBUG
category.HotDBManager= DEBUG
category.BucketMover= DEBUG

The command to recover data is fsck -------- > https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.2.1/Troubleshooting/CommandlinetoolsforusewithSupport#fsck

Example of the fsck command ------------ > https://community.splunk.com/t5/Splunk-Search/splunk-command-to-repair-buckets/m-p/372180

Note, you may directly run this fsck repair command. The fsck utility will always check the data first, if no corruption, no repairing will be performed.

If corruption is detected by the fsck utility, you may run the 'rebuild' command to repair it instead of using the 'fsck' command, e.g.,:

./splunk stop
./splunk rebuild /path/to/your/db

 However, Splunk's built-in "rebuild" command is for a single bucket. So, you may create a script to run multiple buckets rebuild. Be careful of running multiple rebuilds because it will require CPU, memory, and DISK IO.
